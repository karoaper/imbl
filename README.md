This is the implementation of the novel supervised learning algorithm, called IMBL, presented in [this paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B67Xra-_-K9UcmdfOHpFYVBQNDA/view?usp=sharing).  There are three versions of the algorithm, IMBLI, IMBLII, and IMBLIII.  More detailed description of the algorithm, with all variations, including these three variants can be found in this [thesis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B67Xra-_-K9Ucko2QWItbG9aQ2M/view?usp=sharing).
